# Kamino Finance Airdrop

## Tool Description

Kamino Finance is a tool that allows you to be a liquidity provider on many type of coins:
sol staking tokens, stable coins, or main Solana coins.
It also allows to set up easily liquidity pools from a single coin. It comes too with 
borrowing/lending features and leverages on liquidity positions.

## Duties

* The best way to earn points on this platform is to provide liquidities. Stabe pools
are the safest.
* You can then use their borrowing and multiply features too but it comes with more risks.
* You can use leverage for your pools too, but it comes with more risks.
* Token lending with SOLs and USDCs are much more rewarding: https://app.kamino.finance/points?seasonTab=season1&tab=boost
