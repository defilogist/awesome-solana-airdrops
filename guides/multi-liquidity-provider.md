# Multi Liquidity Provider

The different platforms involved in airdrops can be farmed simultaneously. I give in the 
following a few examples.

**Warning: it creates a much bigger risk surface for your holdings. If a single platform is
compromised or if you mess up with one of your deposit, you lose all your fundings.**


## Scenario 1

* Stake SOLs on SolBlaze
* Provide bSOL-SOL liquidities on Kamino
* Borrow Sols on Kamino
* Lend them on Marginfi
* Borrow USDCs on Marginfi
* Lend them on Parcl (30 days locking)

## Scenario 2

* Buy a high-value NFT
* Lend it on Banx
* Use SOLs to stake on Solblaze
* Provide bSOL-SOL liquidities on Kamino
* Stake kbSol-Sol in Lending on Kamino
* Borrow sols on Kamino
* Lend sols on any leverage platforms
