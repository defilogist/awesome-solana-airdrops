# Tensor Trade Airdrop

## Tool Description

Tensor Trade is the leading Solana NFT marketplace. Their point system will lead
to a $TNSR token airdrop. The season 3 is ended, the season 4 just started and will
be rewarded with $TNSR.

## Duties

* Buy or fund Tensor Locks
* Set collection-wide bids on top volume collections (close to the floor)
* List NFTs on top volume collections (close to the floor)
* Set [AMMs](https://thewise.trade/amm-trading-guide) on top volume collections
* Invite friends
* Stake a Tensorian (platform NFT)
* Take advantage of farme collection: set a bid very close to the floor, once accepted
  list the NFT with a similar price.
* Follow price trends to dump a collection that you overbought due to price variations
* Don't optimise your trading if you farm, look mainly for volume and small spreads to avoid big loss. 

The previous seasons rewarded mostly the bidding and the listing. 
You can play with that aspects to farm as much points as possible while
limiting risks. AMMs are well rewarded too but they are harder to manage. 
For this season, the locks will be well rewarded too.
